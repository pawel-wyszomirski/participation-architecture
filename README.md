# Participation Architecture (MVP)

### 🔍 Governance Health & Delegate Fatigue Analytics for Arbitrum DAO

> **Status:** Experimental / Research Preview
> **Grant Category:** Developer Tooling / Governance Analytics

**Project Goal:**
Current DAO governance tools track *votes*, but they don't track the *human cost* of voting. This tool parses Snapshot/on-chain data to diagnose "Delegate Fatigue" and visualize the health of the delegation market beyond simple participation rates.

**Core Features (In Development):**
* 🐍 **Data Parser:** Python script to fetch raw voting patterns via Snapshot API.
* 📊 **Fatigue Index:** Custom metric based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT).
* 🛡️ **Public Good:** Open Source (MIT), no token, privacy-preserving.
